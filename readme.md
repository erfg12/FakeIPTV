## Roll your own Live TV channels for Plex and other IP TV apps.

This app grabs your Plex library and processes your media. Follow the guide to set it up.

Create your channels in the GUI, press the "START STREAM" button when you're ready. VLC streams will start up, an iptv.m3u and XMLTV.xml files will be generated next to the executable file. You can use these files in your IP TV app.

If you want to plug this into Plex, you will need to download [xTeVe](https://xteve.de/). Run the application, point it to the XMLTV.xml and iptv.m3u files. Then go onto https://plex.tv and visit `Account` > `IP TV & DVR` and set it up.
